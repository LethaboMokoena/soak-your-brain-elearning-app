### ABout this project

I made this project for my college degree's final year project work. This is an e-learning management system just like Google's Classroom but opensource.
My initial plan was to develop a SaaS platform but this can be used for local deployments too (with minor tweaks required). I believe that there is a lot of potential in this project.
I will continue to work on this in my free time and make this production ready.

### Note:

-   ALways create the required Groups according to the screenshots provided after all migrations are completed but before deploying/running the app
-   `<script></script>` tags in `base.html` are not available for `college_base.html` and vice versa.
